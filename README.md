# Wht The Phish!!

## Project Large Applications Practicum (Group 4)

>This Project is made to make poeple aware about the phising websites that are increasing at an alarming rate. We have made an education app which will first teach poeple about the various types of phishing URLs which will be followed by an exercise session to ensure that the user actually understood the concepts.

## Datasets

1. [Aalto Phishstrom Dataset](https://research.aalto.fi/en/datasets/phishstorm-phishing-legitimate-url-dataset)
2. [UNB URL Dataset 2016](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/url-2016.html)

## Setting Up the Enviornment

1. Fork The repo
2. Clone it in your local machine using the forked repo
3. Create a virtual enviornment in your local machine in the folder you cloned the repo,

    - ***pip install virtualenv***
    - ***virtualenv env***
    - Activate the virtual env, follow the instructions given after you create a env successfully

4. Then run, ***pip install requirements.txt***

5. If you have reached this step, you are good to go.
